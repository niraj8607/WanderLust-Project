## Wanderlust 🏨
Wanderlust is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, designed to allow users to discover, book, and review unique places to stay around the world. This project demonstrates a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with user authentication, image uploads, and an interactive user interface.

## ✨ Features
User Authentication: Secure user sign-up and login functionality using Passport.js. Authenticated users can manage their listings and post reviews.

CRUD for Listings: Authenticated users can Create new listings, Read details of any listing, Update their own listings, and Delete them.

Image Uploads: Users can upload images for their listings, which are handled by Multer.

Reviews and Ratings: Logged-in users can post reviews and ratings for properties they've visited.

Authorization: Users can only edit or delete the listings and reviews they have created.

Flash Messages: Interactive flash messages provide feedback to the user after performing actions (e.g., "New Listing Created!", "You are logged out!").
